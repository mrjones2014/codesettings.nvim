-- 
-- the second case clause can never be reached because T implements
-- io.Reader and case clauses are evaluated in source order.
-- 
-- Another example:
-- 
--     type T struct{}
--     func (T) Read(b []byte) (int, error) { return 0, nil }
--     func (T) Close() error { return nil }

-- Impossible comparison of interface value with untyped nil
-- 
-- Under the covers, interfaces are implemented as two elements, a
-- type T and a value V. V is a concrete value such as an int,
-- struct or pointer, never an interface itself, and has type T. For
-- instance, if we store the int value 3 in an interface, the
-- resulting interface value has, schematically, (T=int, V=3). The
-- value V is also known as the interface's dynamic value, since a
-- given interface variable might hold different values V (and
-- corresponding types T) during the execution of the program.
-- 
-- An interface value is nil only if the V and T are both
-- unset, (T=nil, V is not set), In particular, a nil interface will
-- always hold a nil type. If we store a nil pointer of type *int
-- inside an interface value, the inner type will be *int regardless
-- of the value of the pointer: (T=*int, V=nil). Such an interface
-- value will therefore be non-nil even when the pointer value V
-- inside is nil.
-- 
-- This situation can be confusing, and arises when a nil value is
-- stored inside an interface value such as an error return:
-- 
--     func returnsError() error {
--         var p *MyError = nil
--         if bad() {
--             p = ErrBad
--         }
--         return p // Will always return a non-nil error.
--     }
-- 
-- If all goes well, the function returns a nil p, so the return
-- value is an error interface value holding (T=*MyError, V=nil).
-- This means that if the caller compares the returned error to nil,
-- it will always look as if there was an error even if nothing bad
-- happened. To return a proper nil error to the caller, the
-- function must return an explicit nil:
-- 
--     func returnsError() error {
--         if bad() {
--             return ErrBad
--         }
--         return nil
--     }
-- 
-- It's a good idea for functions that return errors always to use
-- the error type in their signature (as we did above) rather than a
-- concrete type such as *MyError, to help guarantee the error is
-- created correctly. As an example, os.Open returns an error even
-- though, if not nil, it's always of concrete type *os.PathError.
-- 
-- Similar situations to those described here can arise whenever
-- interfaces are used. Just keep in mind that if any concrete value
-- has been stored in the interface, the interface will not be nil.

-- Possible nil pointer dereference
-- 
-- A pointer is being dereferenced unconditionally, while
-- also being checked against nil in another place. This suggests that
-- the pointer may be nil and dereferencing it may panic. This is
-- commonly a result of improperly ordered code or missing return
-- statements. Consider the following examples:
-- 
--     func fn(x *int) {
--         fmt.Println(*x)
-- 
--         // This nil check is equally important for the previous dereference
--         if x != nil {
--             foo(*x)
--         }
--     }
-- 
--     func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
--         x := compute()
--         if x == nil {
--             t.Errorf("nil pointer received")
--         }
-- 
--         // t.Errorf does not abort the test, so if x is nil, the next line will panic.
--         foo(*x)
--     }
-- 
-- Staticcheck tries to deduce which functions abort control flow.
-- For example, it is aware that a function will not continue
-- execution after a call to panic or log.Fatal. However, sometimes
-- this detection fails, in particular in the presence of
-- conditionals. Consider the following example:
-- 
--     func Log(msg string, level int) {
--         fmt.Println(msg)
--         if level == levelFatal {
--             os.Exit(1)
--         }
--     }
-- 
--     func Fatal(msg string) {
--         Log(msg, levelFatal)
--     }
-- 
--     func fn(x *int) {
--         if x == nil {
--             Fatal("unexpected nil pointer")
--         }
--         fmt.Println(*x)
--     }
-- 
-- Staticcheck will flag the dereference of x, even though it is perfectly
-- safe. Staticcheck is not able to deduce that a call to
-- Fatal will exit the program. For the time being, the easiest
-- workaround is to modify the definition of Fatal like so:
-- 
--     func Fatal(msg string) {
--         Log(msg, levelFatal)
--         panic("unreachable")
--     }
--

-- logrus. Please file an issue if we're missing support for a

-- Missing an optimization opportunity when indexing maps by byte slices
-- 
-- Map keys must be comparable, which precludes the use of byte slices.
-- This usually leads to using string keys and converting byte slices to
-- strings.
-- 
-- Normally, a conversion of a byte slice to a string needs to copy the data and
-- causes allocations. The compiler, however, recognizes m[string(b)] and
-- uses the data of b directly, without copying it, because it knows that
-- the data can't change during the map lookup. This leads to the
-- counter-intuitive situation that
-- 
--     k := string(b)
--     println(m[k])
--     println(m[k])
-- 
-- will be less efficient than
-- 
--     println(m[string(b)])
--     println(m[string(b)])
-- 
-- because the first version needs to copy and allocate, while the second
-- one does not.

-- A sync.Pool is used to avoid unnecessary allocations and reduce the

-- When passing a value that is not a pointer to a function that accepts

-- Should use constants for HTTP error codes, not magic numbers
-- 
-- HTTP has a tremendous number of status codes. While some of those are
-- well known (200, 400, 404, 500), most of them are not. The net/http
-- package provides constants for all status codes that are part of the

-- Don't use Yoda conditions
-- 
-- Yoda conditions are conditions of the kind 'if 42 == x', where the

-- idiom in languages in which assignment is an expression, to avoid bugs
-- of the kind 'if (x = 42)'. In Go, which doesn't allow for this kind of

-- Importing the same package multiple times
-- 
-- Go allows importing the same package multiple times, as long as

--         format "fmt"
--         _ "fmt"

-- intentionally (see for example
-- https://github.com/golang/go/commit/3409ce39bfd7584523b7a8c150a310cea92d879d)

-- replace interface{} with any

-- simplify append chains using slices.Concat
-- 
-- The appendclipped analyzer suggests replacing chains of append calls with a
-- single call to slices.Concat, which was added in Go 1.21. For example,
-- append(append(s, s1...), s2...) would be simplified to slices.Concat(s, s1, s2).
-- 
-- In the simple case of appending to a newly allocated slice, such as
-- append([]T(nil), s...), the analyzer suggests the more concise slices.Clone(s).
-- For byte slices, it will prefer bytes.Clone if the "bytes" package is
-- already imported.
-- 
-- This fix is only applied when the base of the append tower is a
-- "clipped" slice, meaning its length and capacity are equal (e.g.
-- x[:0:0] or []T{}). This is to avoid changing program behavior by
-- eliminating intended side effects on the base slice's underlying

-- apply fixes based on 'go:fix inline' comment directives
-- 
-- The inline analyzer inlines functions and constants that are marked for inlining.
-- 
-- ## Functions
-- 
-- Given a function that is marked for inlining, like this one:
-- 
-- 	//go:fix inline
-- 	func Square(x int) int { return Pow(x, 2) }
-- 
-- this analyzer will recommend that calls to the function elsewhere, in the same
-- or other packages, should be inlined.
-- 
-- Inlining can be used to move off of a deprecated function:
-- 
-- 	// Deprecated: prefer Pow(x, 2).
-- 	//go:fix inline
-- 	func Square(x int) int { return Pow(x, 2) }
-- 
-- It can also be used to move off of an obsolete package,
-- as when the import path has changed or a higher major version is available:
-- 
-- 	package pkg
-- 
-- 	import pkg2 "pkg/v2"
-- 
-- 	//go:fix inline
-- 	func F() { pkg2.F(nil) }
-- 
-- Replacing a call pkg.F() by pkg2.F(nil) can have no effect on the program,
-- so this mechanism provides a low-risk way to update large numbers of calls.
-- We recommend, where possible, expressing the old API in terms of the new one
-- to enable automatic migration.
-- 
-- The inliner takes care to avoid behavior changes, even subtle ones,
-- such as changes to the order in which argument expressions are
-- evaluated. When it cannot safely eliminate all parameter variables,
-- it may introduce a "binding declaration" of the form
-- 
-- 	var params = args
-- 
-- to evaluate argument expressions in the correct order and bind them to
-- parameter variables. Since the resulting code transformation may be
-- stylistically suboptimal, such inlinings may be disabled by specifying
-- the -inline.allow_binding_decl=false flag to the analyzer driver.
-- 
-- (In cases where it is not safe to "reduce" a call—that is, to replace
-- a call f(x) by the body of function f, suitably substituted—the
-- inliner machinery is capable of replacing f by a function literal,
-- func(){...}(). However, the inline analyzer discards all such
-- "literalizations" unconditionally, again on grounds of style.)
-- 
-- ## Constants
-- 
-- Given a constant that is marked for inlining, like this one:
-- 
-- 	//go:fix inline
-- 	const Ptr = Pointer
-- 
-- this analyzer will recommend that uses of Ptr should be replaced with Pointer.
-- 
-- As with functions, inlining can be used to replace deprecated constants and
-- constants in obsolete packages.
-- 
-- A constant definition can be marked for inlining only if it refers to another
-- named constant.
-- 
-- The "//go:fix inline" comment must appear before a single const declaration on its own,
-- as above; before a const declaration that is part of a group, as in this case:
-- 
-- 	const (
-- 	   C = 1
-- 	   //go:fix inline
-- 	   Ptr = Pointer
-- 	)
-- 
-- or before a group, applying to every constant in the group:
-- 
-- 	//go:fix inline
-- 	const (
-- 		Ptr = Pointer
-- 	    Val = Value
-- 	)
-- 
-- The proposal https://go.dev/issue/32816 introduces the "//go:fix inline" directives.
-- 
-- You can use this command to apply inline fixes en masse:
-- 
-- 	$ go run golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/inline/cmd/inline@latest -fix ./...
-- 
-- ```lua
-- default = true
-- ```
---@field inline boolean?
-- check references to loop variables from within nested functions
-- 
-- This analyzer reports places where a function literal references the
-- iteration variable of an enclosing loop, and the loop calls the function
-- in such a way (e.g. with go or defer) that it may outlive the loop
-- iteration and possibly observe the wrong value of the variable.
-- 
-- Note: An iteration variable can only outlive a loop iteration in Go versions <=1.21.
-- In Go 1.22 and later, the loop variable lifetimes changed to create a new
-- iteration variable per loop iteration. (See go.dev/issue/60078.)
-- 
-- In this example, all the deferred functions run after the loop has
-- completed, so all observe the final value of v [<go1.22].
-- 
-- 	for _, v := range list {
-- 	    defer func() {
-- 	        use(v) // incorrect
-- 	    }()
-- 	}
-- 
-- One fix is to create a new variable for each iteration of the loop:
-- 
-- 	for _, v := range list {
-- 	    v := v // new var per iteration
-- 	    defer func() {
-- 	        use(v) // ok
-- 	    }()
-- 	}
-- 
-- After Go version 1.22, the previous two for loops are equivalent
-- and both are correct.
-- 
-- The next example uses a go statement and has a similar problem [<go1.22].
-- In addition, it has a data race because the loop updates v
-- concurrent with the goroutines accessing it.
-- 
-- 	for _, v := range elem {
-- 	    go func() {
-- 	        use(v)  // incorrect, and a data race
-- 	    }()
-- 	}
-- 
-- A fix is the same as before. The checker also reports problems
-- in goroutines started by golang.org/x/sync/errgroup.Group.
-- A hard-to-spot variant of this form is common in parallel tests:
-- 
-- 	func Test(t *testing.T) {
-- 	    for _, test := range tests {
-- 	        t.Run(test.name, func(t *testing.T) {
-- 	            t.Parallel()
-- 	            use(test) // incorrect, and a data race
-- 	        })
-- 	    }
-- 	}
-- 
-- The t.Parallel() call causes the rest of the function to execute
-- concurrent with the loop [<go1.22].
-- 
-- The analyzer reports references only in the last statement,
-- as it is not deep enough to understand the effects of subsequent
-- statements that might render the reference benign.
-- ("Last statement" is defined recursively in compound
-- statements such as if, switch, and select.)

-- replace explicit loops over maps with calls to maps package
-- 
-- The mapsloop analyzer replaces loops of the form

-- 	for k, v := range x { m[k] = v }
-- 
-- with a single call to a function from the `maps` package, added in Go 1.23.
-- Depending on the context, this could be `maps.Copy`, `maps.Insert`,
-- `maps.Clone`, or `maps.Collect`.
-- 
-- The transformation to `maps.Clone` is applied conservatively, as it
-- preserves the nilness of the source map, which may be a subtle change in
-- behavior if the original code did not handle a nil map in the same way.

---@field mapsloop boolean?
-- replace if/else statements with calls to min or max
-- 
-- The minmax analyzer simplifies conditional assignments by suggesting the use
-- of the built-in `min` and `max` functions, introduced in Go 1.21. For example,
-- 
-- 	if a < b { x = a } else { x = b }
-- 
-- is replaced by
-- 
-- 	x = min(a, b).
-- 
-- This analyzer avoids making suggestions for floating-point types,
-- as the behavior of `min` and `max` with NaN values can differ from
-- the original if/else statement.
-- 
-- ```lua
-- default = true
-- ```
---@field minmax boolean?
-- simplify code by using go1.26's new(expr)
-- 
-- This analyzer finds declarations of functions of this form:
-- 
-- 	func varOf(x int) *int { return &x }
-- 
-- and suggests a fix to turn them into inlinable wrappers around
-- go1.26's built-in new(expr) function:
-- 
-- 	//go:fix inline
-- 	func varOf(x int) *int { return new(x) }
-- 
-- (The directive comment causes the 'inline' analyzer to suggest
-- that calls to such functions are inlined.)
-- 
-- In addition, this analyzer suggests a fix for each call
-- to one of the functions before it is transformed, so that
-- 
-- 	use(varOf(123))
-- 
-- is replaced by:
-- 
-- 	use(new(123))

-- check for redundant or impossible nil comparisons
-- 
-- The nilness checker inspects the control-flow graph of each function in

-- pointers, and panics with nil values. A degenerate comparison is of the form
-- x==nil or x!=nil where x is statically known to be nil or non-nil. These are
-- often a mistake, especially in control flow related to errors. Panics with nil
-- values are checked because they are not detectable by
-- 
-- 	if r := recover(); r != nil {
-- 
-- This check reports conditions such as:
-- 
-- 	if f == nil { // impossible condition (f is a function)

---@field rangeint boolean?
-- check for inefficient recursive iterators
-- 
-- This analyzer reports when a function that returns an iterator
-- (iter.Seq or iter.Seq2) calls itself as the operand of a range
-- statement, as this is inefficient.
-- 
-- When implementing an iterator (e.g. iter.Seq[T]) for a recursive
-- data type such as a tree or linked list, it is tempting to
-- recursively range over the iterator for each child element.
-- 
-- Here's an example of a naive iterator over a binary tree:
-- 
-- 	type tree struct {
-- 		value       int
-- 		left, right *tree
-- 	}
-- 
-- 	func (t *tree) All() iter.Seq[int] {
-- 		return func(yield func(int) bool) {
-- 			if t != nil {
-- 				for elem := range t.left.All() { // "inefficient recursive iterator"
-- 					if !yield(elem) {
-- 						return
-- 					}
-- 				}
-- 				if !yield(t.value) {
-- 					return
-- 				}
-- 				for elem := range t.right.All() { // "inefficient recursive iterator"
-- 					if !yield(elem) {
-- 						return
-- 					}
-- 				}
-- 			}
-- 		}
-- 	}
-- 
-- Though it correctly enumerates the elements of the tree, it hides a
-- significant performance problem--two, in fact. Consider a balanced
-- tree of N nodes. Iterating the root node will cause All to be
-- called once on every node of the tree. This results in a chain of
-- nested active range-over-func statements when yield(t.value) is
-- called on a leaf node.
-- 
-- The first performance problem is that each range-over-func
-- statement must typically heap-allocate a variable, so iteration of
-- the tree allocates as many variables as there are elements in the
-- tree, for a total of O(N) allocations, all unnecessary.
-- 
-- The second problem is that each call to yield for a leaf of the
-- tree causes each of the enclosing range loops to receive a value,
-- which they then immediately pass on to their respective yield
-- function. This results in a chain of log(N) dynamic yield calls per
-- element, a total of O(N*log N) dynamic calls overall, when only
-- O(N) are necessary.
-- 
-- A better implementation strategy for recursive iterators is to
-- first define the "every" operator for your recursive data type,
-- where every(f) reports whether an arbitrary predicate f(x) is true
-- for every element x in the data type. For our tree, the every
-- function would be:
-- 
-- 	func (t *tree) every(f func(int) bool) bool {
-- 		return t == nil ||
-- 			t.left.every(f) && f(t.value) && t.right.every(f)
-- 	}
-- 
-- For example, this use of the every operator prints whether every
-- element in the tree is an even number:
-- 
-- 	even := func(x int) bool { return x&1 == 0 }
-- 	println(t.every(even))
-- 
-- Then the iterator can be simply expressed as a trivial wrapper
-- around the every operator:
-- 
-- 	func (t *tree) All() iter.Seq[int] {
-- 		return func(yield func(int) bool) {
-- 			_ = t.every(yield)
-- 		}
-- 	}
-- 
-- In effect, tree.All computes whether yield returns true for each
-- element, short-circuiting if it ever returns false, then discards
-- the final boolean result.
-- 
-- This has much better performance characteristics: it makes one
-- dynamic call per element of the tree, and it doesn't heap-allocate
-- anything. It is also clearer.

-- replace reflect.TypeOf(x) with TypeFor[T]()

-- See https://go.dev/issue/71686 and https://go.dev/issue/74130 for
-- further discussion of these limitations.
-- 
-- The unusedfunc algorithm is not as precise as the
-- golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode tool, but it has the advantage that
-- it runs within the modular analysis framework, enabling near
-- real-time feedback within gopls.
-- 
-- The unusedfunc analyzer also reports unused types, vars, and
-- constants. Enums--constants defined with iota--are ignored since
-- even the unused values must remain present to preserve the logical
-- ordering.
-- 
-- ```lua
-- default = true
-- ```
---@field unusedfunc boolean?
-- check for unused parameters of functions
-- 
-- The unusedparams analyzer checks functions to see if there are
-- any parameters that are not being used.
-- 
-- To ensure soundness, it ignores:
--   - "address-taken" functions, that is, functions that are used as
--     a value rather than being called directly; their signatures may
--     be required to conform to a func type.
--   - exported functions or methods, since they may be address-taken
--     in another package.
--   - unexported methods whose name matches an interface method
--     declared in the same package, since the method's signature
--     may be required to conform to the interface type.
--   - functions with empty bodies, or containing just a call to panic.
--   - parameters that are unnamed, or named "_", the blank identifier.
-- 
-- The analyzer suggests a fix of replacing the parameter name by "_",
-- but in such cases a deeper fix can be obtained by invoking the
-- "Refactor: remove unused parameter" code action, which will
-- eliminate the parameter entirely, along with all corresponding
-- arguments at call sites, while taking care to preserve any side
-- effects in the argument expressions; see
-- https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.14.
-- 
-- This analyzer ignores generated code.
-- 
-- ```lua
-- default = true
-- ```
---@field unusedparams boolean?
-- check for unused results of calls to some functions
-- 
-- Some functions like fmt.Errorf return a result and have no side
-- effects, so it is always a mistake to discard the result. Other
-- functions may return an error that must not be ignored, or a cleanup
-- operation that must be called. This analyzer reports calls to
-- functions like these when the result of the call is ignored.
-- 
-- The set of functions may be controlled using flags.
-- 
-- ```lua

-- ```
---@field unusedresult boolean?
-- check for unused variables and suggest fixes
-- 
-- ```lua
-- default = true
-- ```
---@field unusedvariable boolean?
-- checks for unused writes
-- 
-- The analyzer reports instances of writes to struct fields and
-- arrays that are never read. Specifically, when a struct object
-- or an array is copied, its elements are copied implicitly by
-- the compiler, and any element write to this copy does nothing
-- with the original object.
-- 
-- For example:
-- 
-- 	type T struct { x int }
-- 
-- 	func f(input []T) {
-- 		for i, v := range input {  // v is a copy
-- 			v.x = i  // unused write to field x
-- 		}
-- 	}
-- 
-- Another example is about non-pointer receiver:
-- 
-- 	type T struct { x int }
-- 
-- 	func (t T) f() {  // t is a copy
-- 		t.x = i  // unused write to field x
-- 	}
-- 
-- ```lua
-- default = true
-- ```
---@field unusedwrite boolean?
-- replace wg.Add(1)/go/wg.Done() with wg.Go
-- 
-- The waitgroup analyzer simplifies goroutine management with `sync.WaitGroup`.
-- It replaces the common pattern
-- 
-- 	wg.Add(1)
-- 	go func() {
-- 		defer wg.Done()
-- 		...
-- 	}()
-- 
-- with a single call to
-- 
-- 	wg.Go(func(){ ... })
-- 
-- which was added in Go 1.25.
-- 
-- ```lua
-- default = true
-- ```
---@field waitgroup boolean?
-- report calls to yield where the result is ignored
-- 
-- After a yield function returns false, the caller should not call
-- the yield function again; generally the iterator should return
-- promptly.
-- 
-- This example fails to check the result of the call to yield,
-- causing this analyzer to report a diagnostic:
-- 
-- 	yield(1) // yield may be called again (on L2) after returning false
-- 	yield(2)
-- 
-- The corrected code is either this:
-- 
-- 	if yield(1) { yield(2) }
-- 
-- or simply:
-- 
-- 	_ = yield(1) && yield(2)
-- 
-- It is not always a mistake to ignore the result of yield.
-- For example, this is a valid single-element iterator:
-- 
-- 	yield(1) // ok to ignore result
-- 	return
-- 
-- It is only a mistake when the yield call that returned false may be
-- followed by another call.
-- 
-- ```lua
-- default = true
-- ```

-- directoryFilters can be used to exclude unwanted directories from the

-- standaloneTags specifies a set of build constraints that identify

-- If `$saved_file` is part of the command, rust-analyzer will pass
-- the absolute path of the saved file to the provided command. This is
-- intended to be used with non-Cargo build systems.
-- Note that `$saved_file` is experimental and may be removed in the future.
-- 
-- An example command would be:
-- 
-- ```bash

---@class lsp.rust_analyzer.Workspace
-- Enables automatic discovery of projects using [`DiscoverWorkspaceConfig::command`].
-- 
-- [`DiscoverWorkspaceConfig`] also requires setting `progress_label` and `files_to_watch`.
-- `progress_label` is used for the title in progress indicators, whereas `files_to_watch`
-- is used to determine which build system-specific files should be watched in order to
-- reload rust-analyzer.
-- 
-- Below is an example of a valid configuration:
-- ```json
-- "rust-analyzer.workspace.discoverConfig": {
--         "command": [
--                 "rust-project",
--                 "develop-json"
--         ],
--         "progressLabel": "rust-analyzer",
--         "filesToWatch": [
--                 "BUCK"
--         ]
-- }
-- ```
-- 
-- ## On `DiscoverWorkspaceConfig::command`
-- 
-- **Warning**: This format is provisional and subject to change.
-- 
-- [`DiscoverWorkspaceConfig::command`] *must* return a JSON object corresponding to
-- `DiscoverProjectData::Finished`:
-- 
-- ```norun
-- #[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize, Serialize)]
-- #[serde(tag = "kind")]
-- #[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
-- enum DiscoverProjectData {
--         Finished { buildfile: Utf8PathBuf, project: ProjectJsonData },
--         Error { error: String, source: Option<String> },
--         Progress { message: String },
-- }
-- ```
-- 
-- As JSON, `DiscoverProjectData::Finished` is:
-- 
-- ```json
-- {
--         // the internally-tagged representation of the enum.
--         "kind": "finished",
--         // the file used by a non-Cargo build system to define
--         // a package or target.
--         "buildfile": "rust-analyzer/BUILD",
--         // the contents of a rust-project.json, elided for brevity
--         "project": {
--                 "sysroot": "foo",
--                 "crates": []
--         }
-- }
-- ```
-- 
-- It is encouraged, but not required, to use the other variants on `DiscoverProjectData`
-- to provide a more polished end-user experience.
-- 
-- `DiscoverWorkspaceConfig::command` may *optionally* include an `{arg}`, which will be
-- substituted with the JSON-serialized form of the following enum:
-- 
-- ```norun
-- #[derive(PartialEq, Clone, Debug, Serialize)]
-- #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
-- pub enum DiscoverArgument {
--      Path(AbsPathBuf),
--      Buildfile(AbsPathBuf),
-- }
-- ```
-- 
-- The JSON representation of `DiscoverArgument::Path` is:
-- 
-- ```json
-- {
--         "path": "src/main.rs"
-- }
-- ```
-- 
-- Similarly, the JSON representation of `DiscoverArgument::Buildfile` is:
-- 
-- ```json
-- {
--         "buildfile": "BUILD"
-- }
-- ```
-- 
-- `DiscoverArgument::Path` is used to find and generate a `rust-project.json`, and
-- therefore, a workspace, whereas `DiscoverArgument::buildfile` is used to to update an
-- existing workspace. As a reference for implementors, buck2's `rust-project` will likely
-- be useful: <https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tree/main/integrations/rust-project>.
